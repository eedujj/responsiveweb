            <p> The Bacarra Bell Tower is an integral part of the St. Andrew the Apostle Church, built in the early 17th century during the Spanish colonial era. It stands as an exemplary representation of earthquake baroque architecture, featuring sturdy coral stone and brick construction with a blend of Spanish and Ilocano influences. The tower's primary function was to house church bells, which served to call people to worship and signal important events. It has a distinctive quadrilateral design with ornate details and openings for bells on its upper levels. These bells had various tones and played a vital role in the community, announcing Mass times and events. The tower is a protected historical site, subject to conservation efforts to maintain its historical value. It's a popular tourist attraction known for its unique architectural style and is closely associated with the annual Bac-Bacarra Festival, celebrating the town's cultural heritage.</p>
